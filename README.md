# Password Generator Starter Code
This project really kind of gave me a struggle, used a number of external resources and for whatever reason couldn't seem to make the code cooporate with me

The idea of the project is to be a simple password generator but for me the struggle was making it function, I have all of the user generated variables logged, I created a loop for if the user inputs a non-interger value into the "How many characters" prompt, and tried creating a function to compile these variables into a string while calling for corresponding character codes. 

Frankly I think I just drasticly over thought a lot of things and maybe had my toes in too many varied resources and helped myself into a corner of confusion on this one.
